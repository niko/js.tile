This is a implementation of a subset of the Textile (read about Textile here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) ) markup language. It was first intended to be used just for my S5.t project (still in development). It's aiming to be a lightway implementation of the features usefull for S5 with readable code and tests. Some Regexps are blalently stolen from Jeff Minards implementation (http://www.jrm.cc/), which itself derives from Stuart Langridge (http://www.kryogenix.org/).
